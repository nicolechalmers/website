<h3>Notable Work</h3>
<h4>Thalamus</h4>
<p>
Nicole co-founded
<a href='https://thalamus.ai'>Thalamus</a>
in 2017, with the aim of solving meaningful, real-world problems through the use of artificial intelligence. In its first year, Thalamus has created solutions for
<a href="http://kaidogroup.com">Kaido</a>,
<a href="http://redbrickbills.co.uk">RedBrick Bills</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.bigwideworld.co/">Big Wide World</a>, and been shortlisted for New Business of the Year.
</p>
<p>
Nicole currently splits her time between building
<a href="https://reachora.com">Reachora</a>
- a platform for medical publishers - and developing an artificial intelligence algorithm for use during diagnostic heart-surgery, which if successful will result in improved outcomes for 150,000 patients worldwide each year.
</p>
<h4>Meducation</h4>
<p>
Nicole joined
<a href='https://meducation.net'>Meducation</a>
after their seed round as Head of Product. She led Meducation's development from a small UK site to an internationally respected platform used by 15% of medical students worldwide.
</p>
<p>Meducation provides thousands of free learning resources to medical students, supplementing their formal university learning, and providing access to high-quality teaching material for students from all over the world. It is 100% free.</p>
<h4>Exercism</h4>
<p>
<a href='https://v2.exercism.io'>Exercism</a>
was founded in 2012 by Katrina Owen as a platform to help budding software developers improve their coding skills through mentorship and practice.
</p>
<p>Thalamus took a 30% stake in the company in 2017. Nicole led a full product redevelopment, designing the platform to be friendly, welcoming and accessible to anyone regardless of geography. Exercism is now used by 150,000 software developers worldwide. It is 100% free.</p>
<h4>Project Management</h4>
<p>Before entering the startup world, Nicole wanted to get experience of bigger businesses so worked as a project manager on a number of projects, including an Â£82m infrastructure project for NFU Mutual, a company-wide software upgrade project at Wragge and Co, and a relocation project for Lloyds Banking Group.</p>
<p>While completing these projects, Nicole qualified as both a PRINCE2 Practitioner and an Accredited Project Management under the APM Foundation.</p>
